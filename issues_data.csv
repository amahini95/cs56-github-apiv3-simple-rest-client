16	OPEN	Not Assigned	Add defensive try-catch blocks	Screen scrapers are destined to rot. My nature, they depend on the structure of the particular web site that you are scraping...many websites become restructured and rewritten over the years, which will inevitably break any scrapers using them.To make this screen scraper easier to maintain, add try-catch blocks to any pieces of code that are susceptible to breaking and refer to them in the comments below.I already found one for you as an example. I did not add a try-catch block so go ahead and complete that for a free 100 pts :). Search for the comment that says *issue* on line 284 of UCSBCurriculumSearch.java.Each appropriate try-catch block:Approved 100pts	
15	OPEN	Not Assigned	Create a user-friendly GUI	Currently the program is used through the command line. Create a GUI so that users can enter the information (e.g. CMPSC, Spring, 2014, Undergraduate) in a user-friendly way. I would suggest using drop down menus like it's done on the website being scraped (https://my.sa.ucsb.edu/public/curriculum/coursesearch.aspx).Drop-down menus would require that you would need to scrape all of the departments and store them somewhere (text file) so the program could read them in on start.Approved 500 pts	
14	CLOSED	Not Assigned	Update README.md	Added images and some clarifying text.	
13	OPEN	Not Assigned	Parse enrollCode for lectures with no sections	The lectures and sections seem to be correctly parsing.Enroll codes are only present in sections and not in lectures. However, there are some lectures with no sections at all, such as CMPSCCS 130A of Spring 2014. These lectures DO have Enroll codes.Add an enrollCode data member inside UCSBLecture.java and add/edit the appropriate getters/setters/toString methods.Parse the enroll code for lectures that have no sections.~estimated 100	
12	CLOSED	Kyle Jorgensen	cs56-scapers-ucsb-curriculum: Kevin Mai pull request	jstaahl~requested: 550	
11	CLOSED	Kevin Mai	Allow the user to make course queries (you can get creative here!)	~depends #10 First complete the implementations for the remaining stubbed methods. There are a number of methods with stub implementations but each should be fairly straight forward provided that issue #10 has been completed.Right now the program is hard coded to search for computer science courses in the quarter of S14. Design a search criteria upon which the user can search for courses. This is an opportunity for you to get creative here.  Have you ever thought that Gold's course search or even "Advanced" course search was highly limited and wanted to make more specific searches on courses?  Prompt the user for the search criteria you deem important and print the resulting courses. You may decide the user can input a series of time intervals and be given the results for the courses that do not conflict with these time intervals, etc.  There are infinite possibilities.~estimated 250	
10	CLOSED	Kevin Mai	Implement Section Scraping	Implement the stub method parseSectionHtml() to create section objects that get added to the most recently parsed lecture object. First you will need to fix the method findPrimaryCourseAbbr().~estimated 150

10	OPEN	null	Fuzzy Search	This issue depends on #9 Once search is working for players, add the ability for ["fuzzy search", also known as "approximate string matching"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching). For example if I couldn't remember a player's full first and last name, but I remembered that his first name began with "Han" and his last name began with "Ram", I could search "Han Ram" and be presented with the player "Hanley Ramirez". Or, if I forgot how to spell his name and typed "Hanly Ramirez" I should still be presented with the result for "Hanley Ramirez". There should be some [Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/) library functions available to help achieve this.Estimated 250 pts	
9	OPEN	null	Search functionality	Add the appropriate Java Swing elements to create a "search box" where you can enter the name of a player for which you would like to view statistics. This would be used to filter the data. For example, typing "Tony Gwynn" would result in just the one row of statistics for that player. Alternatively, typing "Gonzalez" should result in the statistics for any player with "Gonzalez" in his name. This means that the search should look at both first and last names. If there are no results found for a given search, then display an appropriate message to the user. The [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) library may be helpful for this. [Here is a simple tutorial](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/4_0_0/tutorial.html). 	
8	OPEN	null	Advanced Stats - Splits	Right now the *Split* class is not used for the display of any statistics. Create a way of viewing an "Advanced Statistics" window, which will contain a similar table layout, but will display statistics for associated splits. It makes the most sense to organize a table of splits by player. So, design a way to select one player, and then display his respective splits. This is an example layout| Split | Statistic_1 | Statistic_2 | Statistic_3 ||-------|---------------|-----------|--------------||  "name of split"  |  aaa | bbb | ccc |For more examples, look at the layout of split statistics [for players on fangraphs.com](http://www.fangraphs.com/statsplits.aspx?playerid=8001&position=SS&season=2013)Estimated 600 pts	
7	OPEN	null	View a player's stats	When viewing the whole table of data, implement the ability to select a player and open a new window with detailed statistics for that player. The exact user interaction which will cause the opening of the new window is left up to the developer. One option might be to double click on a player's name to cause the opening of a new window. Another option might be to add additional buttons next to the table, and when a player's name is selected, the user can click a button to "Show Player Stats" which causes the opening of the new window. Estimated 300 pts	
6	CLOSED	null	Sort stats by column	When viewing the table of statistics, implement the ability to click on the header of a given column to sort the players in the table by the value in that specific column. For example, if you click on the column labeled as HR, then all of the players in the table will be sorted by highest to lowest HR value. This will require some advanced knowledge about the Java Swing GUI elements. Estimated 400 points	
5	OPEN	null	Refactor "global" functions into better object-oriented design	taken from [Conrad's comment on Mantis](https://foo.cs.ucsb.edu/56mantis/view.php?id=785): > As a challenge: see if you can find a way to handle the interaction among the components without resorting to using what amount to "global variables", i.e. the public static references to Main.blah. It takes a bit more thinking, but will result in a more robust piece of code, with more potential for reuse, and fewer opportunities to make errors.The `Main.java` file is the primary location of this issue, with the following static functions```java    public static MainWindow getMainWindow()	{		return mainwindow;	}		public static StatReader getStatReader()	{		return statReader;	}		public static StatKeeper getStatKeeper()	{		return statKeeper;	}```The goal is to abstract the logic for each of these classes, so that you don't need to access the `statReader` or `statKeeper` via the Main class.Estimated 450 pts	
4	CLOSED	null	Add JUnit tests for basic classes	For long-term development of this project, it is very important to have good test coverage of the existing code. Since there are multiple "moving parts" in this project -- from the parsing of the data to calculating statistics and maintaining all the info for lots of players -- tests are helpful to make sure that when we add new functionality we don't break any existing code. Add JUnit tests for the following classes, testing all functions and corner cases. * Player* Split* StatCalculator* StatKeeper* StatManager* StatReader (This one handles the XML parsing, so you may need to also create some "test" XML files)* Statistic* XMLContentHandlerEstimated 300 pts 	
3	CLOSED	null	Add some more javadoc comments	There are some areas of the code that could use some more javadoc comments to explain the functionality of certain classes. Starting with this issue is a good way to understand how this scraper works. The classes that need more javadocs are:* Player* StatManager* StatKeeper* Statistic* XMLContentHandler (if you have time. This class implements an interface called "ContentHandler", so you will need to understand what a ContentHandler does to understand what this class does)Estimated points - 50 ptsEstimated points (including XMLContentHandler) - 80 pts 	
2	CLOSED	Not Assigned	refine code to remove "global vairables"	taken from [Conrad's comment on Mantis](https://foo.cs.ucsb.edu/56mantis/view.php?id=785): > As a challenge: see if you can find a way to handle the interaction among the components without resorting to using what amount to "global variables", i.e. the public static references to Main.blah. It takes a bit more thinking, but will result in a more robust piece of code, with more potential for reuse, and fewer opportunities to make errors.

12	OPEN	Not Assigned	Mash up of the GE Scraper with the UCSB Curriculum Search	There is a project here that allows access to the UCSB Curriculum Search page.   https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-utilities-ucsb-curriculum-htmlunitThat allows you to see what courses are being offered in a particular department in a particular quarter.Do a mash up that allows you to see, for some GE area, which courses from that are are ACTUALLY BEING OFFERED in a particular quarter, e.g. S15.Alternatively, do a mashup that allows you to see, for each GE on an area's list, a list of all quarters that course was offered (from among all the quarters currently available through the UCSB curriculum search page.)   This is helpful because the best 'predictor' of when a course will be offered (and indeed even whether it is EVER going to be offered again) is to see how often it was offered in the recent past, and which quarter(s) it was offered.The next step would be to also indicate for each of those offerings what the enrollment is/was, and the total number of seats in the course, to see whether or not the course is/was/is likely to be full.

3	CLOSED	Not Assigned	Program does not appear to be working	It appears that this application is broken.  A year later after successfully compiling and running the program it seems to have broken.  When entering a course area to get GE's for it freezes and does not display the output it should.  I suspect the HTML contents of the page http://my.sa.ucsb.edu/catalog/current/UndergraduateEducation/AreaE.aspx have most likely changed and the code scraper needs to be re-worked to account for the new HTML.~Estimated 200 points

3	CLOSED	Not Assigned	Add support for choosing different issuing networks	Credit card numbers have different fields with different meanings. For example the first digit signifies the "system", e.g. Visa or Mastercard. For each of these systems, the numbers have different structure and meanings. The app should give the user the ability to choose between systems such as American Express / Visa / Mastercard, and generate valid numbers for each.There is information available on how the numbers are structured [here](http://money.howstuffworks.com/personal-finance/debt-management/credit-card1.htm) and [here](http://www.getcreditcardnumbers.com/).~estimated 200
